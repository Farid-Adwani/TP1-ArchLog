Exercise Before and After Modification
Exercise Before Modification
The original code consists of two classes: Car and CarManager. The Car class defines a car object with three fields: id, model, and brand. The CarManager class is responsible for managing a list of cars, and it includes three methods: getFromDb, getCarsNames, and getBestCar.

getFromDb method searches the car list for a given car ID and returns the car object.
getCarsNames method returns a string that concatenates the brand and model of each car in the car list.
getBestCar method returns the car object with the highest model value.
However, this implementation violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because the CarManager class has multiple responsibilities: managing the car list, searching for a specific car, formatting car names, and rating the best car. Thus, the CarManager class needs to be refactored.

Exercise After Modification
To adhere to the SRP, the original CarManager class has been refactored into four classes: Car, CarRepo, CarFormatter, and CarRater.

Car class remains the same and defines the car object.
CarRepo class is responsible for managing the car list and provides two methods: findById and findAll. findById method searches the car list for a given car ID and returns the car object. findAll method returns the list of all the cars in the car list.
CarFormatter class is responsible for formatting the car names and provides the getCarsNames method. This method takes a list of cars and returns a string that concatenates the brand and model of each car in the car list.
CarRater class is responsible for rating the best car and provides the getBestCar method. This method takes a list of cars and returns the car object with the highest model value.
The new CarManager class utilizes the above-created classes and has the following methods: getCarById, getCarsNames, and getBestCar. getCarById method calls the findById method of CarRepo to search the car list for a given car ID and returns the car object. getCarsNames method calls the getCarsNames method of CarFormatter to format the car names and returns the formatted string. Finally, getBestCar method calls the getBestCar method of CarRater to get the best car and returns the car object.

By following the SRP, the code has become more modular, easier to maintain, and flexible to change. Now each class has a single responsibility, which makes the code more organized and testable.
